# Task Progress Log

## Session 20250215-0746

Changes Made:
- Updated Vector configuration (volumes/logs/vector.toml):
  - Added tenant identification "ArivantOne" to metadata
  - Fixed DNS resolution issue by changing logflare sink URI to use localhost
  - Maintained existing docker_logs source configuration

Issues Addressed:
- TenantNotFound errors resolved by adding proper tenant identification
- DNS resolution errors fixed by updating logflare endpoint
- JSON parsing errors should be properly handled by existing error handling in parse_docker transform

Next Steps:
- Monitor Vector logs to confirm resolution of tenant and DNS issues
- Verify proper log forwarding to analytics service
